# FEVM Web3Jobs

## Installation

```
yarn install
```

This will install the dependencies the kit needs to work.

## Get a Private Key

You can get a private key from a wallet provider [such as Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).

## Add your Private Key as an Environment Variable

Add your private key as an environment variable by running this command: 
 
 ```
export PRIVATE_KEY='abcdef'
```

 \
If you use a .env file, don't commit and push any changes to .env files that may contain sensitive information, such as a private key! If this information reaches a public GitHub repository, someone can use it to check if you have any Mainnet funds in that wallet address, and steal them!


## Get the Deployer Address

Run this command:
```
yarn hardhat get-address
```

The f4address is the filecoin representation of your Ethereum address. This will be needed for the faucet in the next step.

The Ethereum address will be used otherwise.


## Fund the Deployer Address

Go to the [Wallaby faucet](https://wallaby.network/#faucet), and paste in the f4 address we copied in the previous step. This will send some wallaby testnet FIL to the account.


## Deploy the Web3Jobs Contract

Type in the following command in the terminal: 
 
 ```
yarn hardhat deploy
```

This will compile the contract and deploy it to the Wallaby network automatically!

Keep note of the deployed contract address for the next step.
